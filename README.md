Arduino projects
================

I'm currently using [Arscons](http://code.google.com/p/arscons/) for building
and linking as a replacement to the Arduino IDE.

There is a sample SConstruct file called `SConstruct.sample` with some minor modifications, namely the addition of `/dev/ttyACM*` as possible Arduino devices in Linux.
